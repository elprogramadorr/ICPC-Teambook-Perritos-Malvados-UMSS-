# Generator Notebook Usage
Requires: [python](https://www.python.org/), [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/)

The python script `generate_pdf.py`generates the notebook in PDF, this script reads the contents of the notebook from `contents.txt`.


`contents.txt` has the following format:
```
[Section name]
subfolder/file.cpp  Description of the file      # Optional end-of-line comment
```
The python script was taken from [Stanford ICPC Notebook](https://github.com/jaehyunp/stanfordacm).
